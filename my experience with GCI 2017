Hello all,

I am Krishna Pandit. I am 15 years old and I am from India. I am participating in the Google Code-in 2017 which is the world's biggest 
open source based competition for the teenagers. I love open source a lot. I love Google. Google is one of the most influential companies.
I have learnt a lot by participating in the Google Code-in 2017. According to me, the biggest advantage if open source is that people work 
with each other and strive to build a better product for the world. I am participating in the GCI 2017 with the JBoss Community.

I love iconography, UI/UX design, coding and android app developement a lot. Till today, I have completed 7 tasks offered by 
JBoss Community. JBoss Community has offered those tasks which I love to complete it as soon as possible. Their mentorship is very 
effective and awesome. I have alsways strived to get my task accepted by the mentors in the first attempt only. I love the tasks offered by
JBoss Community and I never tried to commit any mistake. 

Now, I am confirmed that I will definitely get the Google Code-in T-Shirt and the certificate. Open Source is one of the best type of 
learning. Through open source, we learn from each other. We share our work with each other, taking guidance from each other and learning
equally. Open Source opens the vast opportunities to create the best using the technology.

I am hoping that I will continue to learn from open source and also, I will put my best to open source my projects as well.
